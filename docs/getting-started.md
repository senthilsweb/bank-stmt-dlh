# Getting started

## Try it in two minutes

You need Python 3.12 or newer, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and `make`.

Synthetic statements for a fictional company (ConceptLabs) are in `samples/statements`: four monthly statements
(July to October 2026) and two weekly ones that overlap October, no password. The payee map shipped in `config/`
matches them.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/senthilsweb/bank-stmt-dlh.git
cd bank-stmt-dlh
make setup                                      # uv sync
make test                                       # 45 unit tests
STATEMENTS_DIR=samples/statements make extract  # parse and reconcile -> data/silver/*.parquet
make gold                                       # categorize, recurring -> data/bank.duckdb
make report                                     # print the reports
```

`make extract` prints one line per statement, reconciled or failed. `make report` shows the statements, the monthly
summary, spend by category, the categorization source mix, upcoming payments (detected and declared, including one
ended engagement) and the founder ledger.

```
6 statements, 80 transactions, 0 failed reconciliation
```

Regenerate the samples with `python scripts/make_sample_statements.py`. Make a text logo for your own company with
`python scripts/make_text_logo.py "Your Company"` (used by the weekly report and its PDFs).

## Your own statements

1. `cp .env.sample .env`. Set `PDF_PASSWORD` (HDFC protects each statement with one) and `STATEMENTS_DIR`.
   Never commit `.env`.
2. Edit `config/merchant_map.yaml` (known payees) and `config/recurring_declared.yaml` (yearly payments). The shipped
   files hold fictional names. `config/rules.yaml` and `config/categories.yaml` are generic and a good start.
3. `make extract`, `make gold`, `make report`.

A statement for a running month is partial; drop the full one in after month end. Weekly statements may overlap
monthly ones. Each line item is identified by date, reference, amount and running balance, so a line already loaded
is counted once; the monthly text wins.

## What the parser expects

One text line per transaction, as `pdfplumber` extracts it from an HDFC current account statement:

```
DD/MM/YY  narration  <reference, 10 to 20 digits>  DD/MM/YY  amount  closing balance
```

Direction comes from the running balance, never from a column. The period comes from the `From : ... To : ...`
line and the totals from the `STATEMENT SUMMARY` block. Another bank is one parser module that returns the same
columns as `src/extract.py`.
